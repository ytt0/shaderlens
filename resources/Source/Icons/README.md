### Path Data Cleanup
1. Open [OMGSVG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/)

2. Paste the content of the svg file
    - Uncheck "**Clean up IDs**"
    - Uncheck "**Remove hidden elements**"
    - Check "**Prefer viewBox to width/height**" to see that it was loaded correctly

3. Copy back a clean svg content
    - Find the clean path data according to its id
