===================

Visual Studio has many convenient features for text editing and code inspection, and using it for writing shaders, could ease the development.

GLSL and C# are both "C-style" languages, and it's possible to have a C# code that "looks" like a GLSL code with minor differences, that could be easily fixed to produce a valid GLSL code.
