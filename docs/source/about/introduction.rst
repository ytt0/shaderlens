Introduction
============

**Shaderlens** is an easy to use shader viewer, designed to make the process of writing shaders, and inspecting render results, as simple as possible.

Shaderlens is built to be compatible with `Shadertoy <https://www.shadertoy.com>`_'s main features and conventions. It runs a sequence of fragment shaders, each rendering to its own framebuffer, and referencing other framebuffers and textures. It also provides compatible input texture, and built-in uniforms.

It supports source files hot reload, making it easy to work with any code editor.
